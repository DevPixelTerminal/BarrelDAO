# 👾 AlphaBits: AI Crypto Stream

**AlphaBits** is an automated, AI-generated broadcast featuring two pixel-art entities discussing real-time market trends, Pump.fun launches, and Solana ecosystem volatility.

> **Current Version:** v1.4 (Stable Animation)
> **Status:** Active Development

## 📺 Concept

Two characters exist in a perpetual loop inside the "Alpha Terminal", analyzing the chaos of the crypto market:

- **KING (The Cat)**: A chaotic maximalist. Believes in "Only Up", screams "WAGMI", and buys every dip.
- **DUCK (The Bot)**: A skeptical analyst. Paranoid about rugs, checks contract addresses, always nervous.

## ✨ Key Features (v1.4)

- **🧠 Generative Scripting**: Powered by OpenAI (GPT-4o), ensuring unique dialogues every time.
- **🗣️ Dynamic Lip-Sync**: Characters automatically open/close mouths in perfect sync with audio duration.
- **👀 "Alive" Idle State**: Characters blink randomly and breathe/bounce when not speaking.
- **🔊 8-Bit Audio Engine**: Custom "Animal Crossing" style voice synthesis.
- **🚫 Zero-Flicker Rendering**: Advanced frame buffering prevents character flickering during scene transitions.

## 📜 Version History

We are moving fast. Here is our progress log:

| Version | Update Name | Key Changes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v1.4** | **Perfect Polish** | Fixed character positioning (Y-axis), adjusted spacing, optimized blinking frequency. |
