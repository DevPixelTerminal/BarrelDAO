# 👾 AlphaBits: The AI Sentiment Terminal

**AlphaBits** is an autonomous, high-frequency AI broadcast engineered to decode the chaos of the Solana ecosystem. It combines **LLM-driven market analysis** with retro-gaming aesthetics to create the ultimate "Good Cop / Bad Cop" experience for crypto traders.

> **Current Version:** v3.3 (Stable UI & Bi-Directional Anchors)
> **Status:** 🚀 Hyper-Speed Development

## 🧠 The Concept: "Sentiment vs. Security"

Two AI agents exist in a perpetual feedback loop, analyzing live market data and user interactions:

- **👑 KING (The Degen)**: Represents **Greed & FOMO**. Uses sentiment analysis to detect viral potential. Screams "WAGMI", buys every dip, and ignores red flags.
- **🤖 DUCK (The Bot)**: Represents **Fear & Logic**. Analyzes on-chain data for risk. Paranoid about rugs, checks liquidity locks, and begs you to take profits.

## ✨ Key Features (v3.3)

### 🎨 Cinematic UI Engine
- **RPG Dialogue System**: Custom "Undertale-style" text rendering with colored bounding boxes specific to each character.
- **Bi-Directional Anchoring**: Advanced vector logic ensures speech bubble "tails" always point correctly to the speaker, regardless of text length.
- **Auto-Expanding Layout**: Dynamic padding calculation prevents text overflow, scaling seamlessly from 1 word to full paragraphs.

### ⚙️ Core Architecture
- **Typewriter FX**: Character-by-character text generation synced with audio timing.
- **Anti-Jitter Sprites**: Smart centering algorithms prevent asset displacement during "Blink" or "Talk" animations.
- **Audio Synthesis**: Custom 8-bit voice modulation (Deep/Fast for King, High/Slow for Bot).

## 📜 Version History

We ship daily. Here is our changelog:

| Version | Update Name | Key Innovations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v3.3** | **Stable Tails** | Implemented bi-directional anchor logic. Cat's tail now correctly locks to the right, Bot's to the left. Zero "floating" artifacts. |
| **v3.0** | **Safe-Text** | Added "Safety Padding" and font resizing logic to prevent text overflow in long sentences. |
| **v2.8** | **Speech Tails** | Added procedural triangle rendering to speech bubbles for comic-book style directionality. |
| **v2.7** | **Color Identity** | UI overhaul: King gets Navy/Gold theme, Bot gets Brown/Yellow theme. |
| **v2.6** | **Undertale Style** | Switched to high-contrast RPG aesthetics (Courier font, Black boxes, White borders). |
| **v2.1** | **Typewriter** | Introduced dynamic text rendering time-synced with `wav` file duration. |
| **v1.5** | **Pixel Perfect** | Aligned characters to exact Photoshop coordinates (Y-axis anchor fix). |
| **v1.0** | **Genesis** | Initial release. Static images + OpenAI logic. |

## 🗺️ Roadmap: The Intelligence Layer

We are building the first **Visual AI Layer** for DeFi.

### 🚧 Phase 2: Utility & Analysis (Active Sprint)
*Focus: Real-time Data Integration*

- [ ] **"Wallet Roast" Feature**:
    - Users submit their wallet address via chat.
    - The AI analyzes their worst trades (PnL) and "roasts" their decision-making live.
- [ ] **Live "Rug Check" Debates**: 
    - **Duck** scans contract code (Honeypot/Liquidity).
    - **King** scans social sentiment (Twitter/Telegram).
    - They debate live: "Alpha or Scam?".
- [ ] **Reactive Environment**: Background lighting shifts Red/Green based on real-time Solana price action.

### 🚀 Phase 3: Gamification (Next Up)
*Focus: Community Interaction*

- [ ] **AI Rap Battles**: Characters generate rhymes about trending coins on the fly.
- [ ] **Chat-Controlled Portfolio**: Chat votes (!buy / !sell) influence the AI's virtual wallet.
- [ ] **$BITS Token**: Governance token allowing holders to train the AI's personality parameters.
