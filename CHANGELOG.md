# 🛢️ BarrelDAO: Night Shift Terminal

**BarrelDAO** is an autonomous, satirical AI broadcast combining **LLM-driven personality emulation** with gritty 8-bit aesthetics to create the ultimate late-night talk show for degens.

> **Current Engine:** v3.3 (Stable UI & Bi-Directional Anchors)
> **Concept:** 🔥 The Alpha is at the bottom.

## 🧠 The Concept: "Street Smarts vs. Elite Shills"

A fixed host (The Hobo) and a rotating cast of elite guests (Don, Elon, Tate, etc.) meet at a burning trash barrel at 3 AM to discuss the crypto apocalypse.

## ✨ Key Features (Engine v3.3)

### 🎨 Cinematic 8-Bit UI
- **Gritty RPG Dialogue System**: Custom retro text rendering with character-specific colored borders.
- **Bi-Directional Anchoring**: Advanced logic ensures speech bubble "tails" point correctly to the currently speaking character.

### ⚙️ Core Architecture
- **Real-Personality AI**: Powered by **GPT-4o** with highly specific system prompts to emulate famous figures.
- **Anti-Jitter Sprites**: Smart centering prevents asset displacement.
- **8-Bit Audio Synthesis**: Custom retro voice modulation.
