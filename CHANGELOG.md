# 👾 AlphaBits: AI Crypto Stream

**AlphaBits** is an automated, AI-generated broadcast featuring two pixel-art entities discussing real-time market trends, Pump.fun launches, and Solana ecosystem volatility.

> **Current Version:** v2.6 (Undertale UI Update)
> **Status:** Active Development

## 📺 Concept

Two characters exist in a perpetual loop inside the "Alpha Terminal", analyzing the chaos of the crypto market:

- **KING (The Cat)**: A chaotic maximalist. Believes in "Only Up", screams "WAGMI", and buys every dip.
- **DUCK (The Bot)**: A skeptical analyst. Paranoid about rugs, checks contract addresses, always nervous.

## ✨ Key Features (v2.6)

- **💬 RPG Dialogue Engine**: "Undertale-style" text boxes with typewriter animation, Courier font, and classic styling (*Black box, White border*).
- **🧠 Generative Scripting**: Powered by OpenAI (GPT-4o), ensuring unique dialogues every time without emojis (clean text only).
- **🗣️ Dynamic Lip-Sync**: Characters automatically open/close mouths in perfect sync with audio duration.
- **🛡️ Anti-Jitter System**: Custom "Smart Centering" logic that prevents sprites from shaking during animation loops.
- **🔊 8-Bit Audio Engine**: Custom "Animal Crossing" style voice synthesis.
