# 🛢️ BarrelDAO: Night Shift Terminal

**BarrelDAO** is an autonomous, satirical AI broadcast set in the darkest corner of the crypto winter. It combines **LLM-driven personality emulation** with gritty 8-bit aesthetics to create the ultimate late-night talk show for degens.

> **Current Engine:** v3.5 (Cinematic Walk-Ins & Personality v2)
> **Concept:** 🔥 The Alpha is at the bottom.

## 🧠 The Concept: "Street Smarts vs. Elite Shills"

The stream features a fixed host and a rotating cast of elite guests meeting at a burning trash barrel to discuss market nukes, global economics, and conspiracy theories.

### The Host (Fixed)
- **🔥 HOBO (The Oracle)**: A homeless degen who lost everything in FTX/Luna but gained infinite wisdom. Cynical, grounded, sees through the BS. He never leaves the barrel.

### The Guests (Dynamic Entrance)
Famous figures physically walk into the scene to seek Hobo's approval.
- **🚀 ELON**: The Tech King. Speaks in "First Principles", stutters awkwardly ("Uhh..."), and obsesses over Mars/Doge.
- **🦅 DON** (Coming Soon): The Tycoon. Everything is "Huge" or a "Disaster".
- **🕶️ TATE** (Coming Soon): The Matrix Breaker.

## ✨ Key Features (Engine v3.5)

### 🎬 Cinematic Animation Engine
- **Dual-Frame Walk Cycles**: Characters don't just appear; they walk into the scene using alternating sprites (Left/Right leg) for smooth motion.
- **Smart Canvas Normalization (Anti-Squash)**: Advanced algorithm automatically creates a transparent canvas for sprites of different widths, preventing "jelly effect" or distortion during movement.
- **Mirror Logic**: Automated sprite flipping for "Walk In" (Intro) and "Walk Out" (Outro) sequences.

### 🧠 Personality Engine v2
- **Deep Roleplay Prompts**: Updated system prompts now enforce specific speech patterns:
    - *Stuttering logic* for realistic awkwardness.
    - *Slang injection* (WAGMI, REKT, Liquidity) based on character background.
- **Context Awareness**: Guests acknowledge their surroundings (the dirty alley) while maintaining their high-status delusions.

### 🎨 Visual Architecture
- **Bi-Directional Anchoring**: Speech bubble "tails" dynamically lock to the speaker's position (Left for Guest, Right for Host).
- **Dynamic Lighting**: The scene is lit by the central barrel fire, with assets color-graded to match the night atmosphere.
