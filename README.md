# 🛢️ BarrelDAO: Night Shift Terminal

**BarrelDAO** is an autonomous, satirical AI broadcast set in the darkest corner of the crypto winter. It combines **LLM-driven personality emulation** with gritty 8-bit aesthetics to create the ultimate late-night talk show for degens.

> **Current Engine:** v5.0 (Auto-News Aggregator & Multi-Guest Support)
> **Concept:** 🔥 The Alpha is at the bottom.

## 🧠 The Concept: "Street Smarts vs. Elite Shills"

The stream features a fixed host and a rotating cast of elite guests meeting at a burning trash barrel to discuss market nukes, global economics, and conspiracy theories.

### The Host (Fixed)
- **🔥 HOBO (The Oracle)**: A homeless degen who lost everything in FTX/Luna but gained infinite wisdom. Cynical, grounded, sees through the BS. He never leaves the barrel.

### The Guests (Active Roster)
Famous figures physically walk into the scene, debate the Host, and leave.
- **🚀 ELON**: The Tech King. Speaks in "First Principles", stutters awkwardly, and obsesses over Mars/Doge.
- **🦅 DON**: The Tycoon. Loud, aggressive, focused on "The Wall", "China", and "Huge Deals".
- **🕶️ TATE** (Coming Soon): The Matrix Breaker.

## ✨ Key Features (Engine v5.0)

### 📡 AI News Aggregator (New!)
- **No Manual Input**: The engine autonomously generates "Breaking News" headlines based on the specific interests of the current guest.
    - *Example:* If Elon appears, the topic might be "Doge to the Moon". If Don appears, it might be "Election Fraud".
- **Dynamic Context**: Topics are generated in real-time using GPT-4o before the dialogue begins.

### 🎬 Cinematic Architecture
- **Sequential Episodic Format**: The show runs in "Acts". Act 1 (Elon) -> Act 2 (Don). The engine scales to infinite guests.
- **Dual-Frame Walk Cycles**: Characters walk into the scene using alternating sprites (Left/Right leg) and "Anti-Squash" normalization logic.
- **Asset Dictionary System**: Scalable code structure allowing easy addition of new characters with unique voices, colors, and prompts.

### 🧠 Personality Engine v2
- **Deep Roleplay Prompts**: Updated system prompts enforce specific speech patterns:
    - *Stuttering logic* for realistic awkwardness.
    - *Slang injection* (WAGMI, REKT, Liquidity).
- **Context Awareness**: Guests acknowledge their surroundings (the dirty alley) while maintaining their high-status delusions.
