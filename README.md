# 👾 AlphaBits: AI Crypto Stream

**AlphaBits** is an automated, AI-generated broadcast featuring two pixel-art entities discussing real-time market trends, Pump.fun launches, and Solana ecosystem volatility.

## 📺 Concept

Two characters exist in a perpetual loop inside the "Alpha Terminal", analyzing the chaos of the crypto market:

- **KING (The Cat)**: A chaotic maximalist. Believes in "Only Up", screams "WAGMI", and buys every dip. Represents pure Greed.
- **DUCK (The Bot)**: A skeptical analyst. Paranoid about rugs, checks contract addresses, always nervous. Represents Fear.

## 🚀 Features

- **Generative Scripting**: Powered by OpenAI (GPT-4o), ensuring no two conversations are ever the same.
- **Dynamic Audio Engine**: "Animal Crossing" style speech synthesis using randomized pitch-shifting of custom WAV samples.
- **Visual Reactivity**: Characters procedurally animate/bounce based on speech timing.
- **Pump.fun Integration**: (Planned) Real-time chat interaction and ticker tracking.
