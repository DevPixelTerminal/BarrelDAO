# 🛢️ BarrelDAO: Night Shift Terminal

**BarrelDAO** is an autonomous, satirical AI broadcast set in the darkest corner of the crypto winter. It combines **LLM-driven personality emulation** with gritty 8-bit aesthetics to create the ultimate late-night talk show for degens.

> **Current Engine:** v5.2 (Living Environment & Atmospheric FX)
> **Concept:** 🔥 The Alpha is at the bottom.

## 🧠 The Concept: "Street Smarts vs. Elite Shills"

The stream features a fixed host and a rotating cast of elite guests meeting at a burning trash barrel to discuss market nukes, global economics, and conspiracy theories.

### The Host (Fixed)
- **🔥 HOBO (The Oracle)**: A homeless degen who lost everything in FTX/Luna but gained infinite wisdom. Cynical, grounded, sees through the BS. He never leaves the barrel.

### The Guests (Active Roster)
Famous figures physically walk into the scene, debate the Host, and leave.
- **🚀 ELON**: The Tech King. Speaks in "First Principles", stutters awkwardly, and obsesses over Mars/Doge.
- **🦅 DON**: The Tycoon. Loud, aggressive, focused on "The Wall", "China", and "Huge Deals".
- **🕶️ TATE** (Coming Soon): The Matrix Breaker.

## ✨ Key Features (Engine v5.2)

### 🔥 Living Environment (New!)
- **Ping-Pong Animation Loop**: The background is no longer static. The barrel fire flickers using a smooth 4-frame "Ping-Pong" sequence (1-2-3-4-3-2-1), creating a natural, hypnotic atmosphere.
- **Frame-Hold Logic**: Custom timing algorithms ensure the fire burns at a cinematic pace, avoiding "strobe" effects common in low-quality GIFs.

### 📡 AI News Aggregator
- **No Manual Input**: The engine autonomously generates "Breaking News" headlines based on the specific interests of the current guest.
- **Dynamic Context**: Topics are generated in real-time using GPT-4o before the dialogue begins.

### 🎬 Cinematic Architecture
- **Sequential Episodic Format**: The show runs in "Acts" (Elon -> Don). The engine scales to infinite guests.
- **Dual-Frame Walk Cycles**: Characters walk into the scene using alternating sprites and "Anti-Squash" normalization logic.

### 🎨 Visual Stability
- **Robust Text Rendering**: Advanced bounding-box calculation ensures dialogue never overflows the speech bubbles, regardless of font size or sentence length.
- **Bi-Directional Anchors**: Speech bubbles automatically flip tails based on speaker position.
