\# 👾 AlphaBits: AI Crypto Stream



\*\*AlphaBits\*\* is an automated, AI-generated broadcast featuring two pixel-art entities discussing real-time market trends, Pump.fun launches, and Solana ecosystem volatility.



\## 📺 Concept

Two characters exist in a perpetual loop inside the "Alpha Terminal", analyzing the chaos of the crypto market:

\- \*\*KING (The Cat)\*\*: A chaotic maximalist. Believes in "Only Up", screams "WAGMI", and buys every dip. Represents pure Greed.

\- \*\*DUCK (The Bot)\*\*: A skeptical analyst. Paranoid about rugs, checks contract addresses, always nervous. Represents Fear.



\## 🚀 Features

\- \*\*Generative Scripting\*\*: Powered by OpenAI (GPT-4o), ensuring no two conversations are ever the same.

\- \*\*Dynamic Audio Engine\*\*: "Animal Crossing" style speech synthesis using randomized pitch-shifting of custom WAV samples.

\- \*\*Visual Reactivity\*\*: Characters procedurally animate/bounce based on speech timing.

\- \*\*Pump.fun Integration\*\*: (Planned) Real-time chat interaction and ticker tracking.



\## 🛠 Tech Stack

\- \*\*Core\*\*: Python 3.10

\- \*\*Visuals\*\*: MoviePy + PIL

\- \*\*Logic\*\*: OpenAI API

\- \*\*Audio\*\*: Custom 8-bit Soundfont Engine
