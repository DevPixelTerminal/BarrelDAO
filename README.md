# 👾 AlphaBits: The AI Sentiment Terminal

**AlphaBits** is an autonomous, high-frequency AI broadcast engineered to decode the chaos of the Solana ecosystem. It combines **LLM-driven market analysis** with retro-gaming aesthetics to create the ultimate "Good Cop / Bad Cop" experience for crypto traders.

> **Current Version:** v3.0 (Undertale UI & Safe-Text Engine)
> **Status:** 🚀 Hyper-Speed Development

## 🧠 The Concept: "Sentiment vs. Security"

Two AI agents exist in a perpetual feedback loop, analyzing live market data and user interactions:

- **👑 KING (The Degen)**: Represents **Greed & FOMO**. Uses sentiment analysis to detect viral potential. Screams "WAGMI", buys every dip, and ignores red flags.
- **🤖 DUCK (The Auditor)**: Represents **Fear & Logic**. Analyzes on-chain data for risk. Paranoid about rugs, checks liquidity locks, and begs you to take profits.

Together, they provide a balanced (and chaotic) view of every new token launch on Pump.fun.

## ✨ Technical Architecture (v3.0)

AlphaBits is built on a custom Python engine that orchestrates multiple AI layers:

### 🎨 Visuals & UI
* **RPG Dialogue Engine**: Custom "Undertale-style" text rendering with dynamic bounding box calculation and typewriter effects.
* **Pixel-Perfect Compositing**: Procedural animation system aligned to exact screen coordinates using RGBA layering.
* **Reactive Sprites**: Anti-jitter logic ensures smooth state transitions (Idle → Talk → Blink).

### ⚙️ Core Logic
* **Generative Narrative**: Powered by **GPT-4o** with strict "No-Emoji" prompt engineering for clean, retro-terminal text output.
* **Dynamic Audio Synthesis**: Custom "8-bit Voice Engine" that modulates pitch and speed based on character personality (Deep/Fast for King, High/Slow for Duck).
* **Lip-Sync Algo**: Frame-accurate mouth movement synchronization with generated audio duration.

## 🗺️ Roadmap: The Path to Singularity

We are building fast. No long wait times. Just shipping.

### ✅ Phase 1: Genesis (Completed)
- [x] Core Python Animation Engine deployment.
- [x] Character asset design & transparent layering.
- [x] **v2.0 UI Overhaul**: Undertale-style text boxes & color coding.
- [x] Audio synthesis & Lip-sync logic.

### 🚧 Phase 2: The Intelligence Layer (Active Sprint)
*Focus: Real-time Data & Utility*

- [ ] **Live "Rug Check" Debates**: 
    - Users paste a Contract Address (CA) in chat.
    - **Duck** scans code (Honeypot/Liquidity check).
    - **King** scans social sentiment (Twitter/Telegram hype).
    - They debate live: "Alpha or Scam?".
- [ ] **"Wallet Roast" Feature**:
    - Users submit their wallet address.
    - The AI analyzes their worst trades and "roasts" their PnL live on stream.
- [ ] **Market Reactivity**: Background environment shifts colors (Red/Green) based on real-time Solana price action.

### 🚀 Phase 3: Gamification & Economy (Next Up)
*Focus: Community Interaction*

- [ ] **AI Rap Battles**: Characters generate rhymes about trending coins on the fly.
- [ ] **Interactive Events**: 
    - Chat votes (!buy / !sell) influence the AI's "virtual portfolio".
    - Donations trigger visual chaos (Explosions, Confetti, Laser Eyes).
- [ ] **$BITS Token Launch**: Governance token allowing holders to train the AI's personality.
