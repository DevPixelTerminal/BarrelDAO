# 🛢️ BarrelDAO: Night Shift Terminal (v7.1)

> **Status:** Autonomous | **Uptime:** 24/7 | **Vibe:** Adult Swim / Crypto Satire

**BarrelDAO** is a fully autonomous, generative pixel-art sitcom engine. It simulates a late-night talk show in a dirty alleyway, hosted by a crypto-homeless sage. The engine combines **LLM-driven improv comedy** with **retro 32-bit aesthetics** to create endless content about the absurdity of modern economics, tech, and politics.

## ⚙️ Engine Mechanics (Under the Hood)

### 1. The "Chaos" Satire Engine (v7.0)
We abandoned standard news feeds for pure generative madness.
* **Step 1 (Topic):** The engine asks GPT-4o to invent a **tabloid-style headline** based on the guest's vices (Ego, Greed, Delusion).
    * *Example:* "Elon admits he is actually 3 raccoons in a trench coat."
* **Step 2 (Script):** A second AI call generates a 12-16 line script using strict "Internet Slang" parameters (WAGMI, REKT, Copium) and enforces **English-only** output.

### 2. Smooth Gradient Weather (v7.1)
The environment creates a living atmosphere using `numpy` linear interpolation.
* **Cycle:** Dry -> Rain starts (10%) -> Heavy Rain (100%) -> Drying Puddles -> Snow -> Melting.
* **Physics:** Raindrop and snowflake counts are dynamically calculated based on the current intensity float value.
* **Visuals:** Ground reflections (puddles) fade in and out smoothly over 15-episode cycles.

### 3. Smart Bubble Rendering
Text generation is unpredictable. To prevent UI glitches:
* **Boundary Injection:** The render pipeline calculates text width in real-time and mathematically forces the text bubble inside the 1280x720 canvas (`x > 20`).
* **Dynamic Typing:** Uses a typewriter effect synchronized with 8-bit audio blips.

### 4. Audio & Codec Pipeline
* **Voice:** Procedural 8-bit beeping (Animal Crossing style), pitch-shifted per character.
* **Encoding:** Forces `AAC` audio codec via FFMPEG to ensure compatibility with OBS and YouTube Live streams on Windows Server environments.

## 🛠 Configuration Guide

To tweak characters, edit the `ASSETS` dictionary in `run_infinity.py`.

```python
"CHAR_NAME": {
    "SCALE": 1.0,          # Size multiplier
    "SPOT_X": 500,         # Horizontal Position (Left <-> Right)
    "OFFSET_Y": 0,         # Vertical shift
    
    # AI Persona Injection
    "WHO_IS_HE": "Description of the character's psyche...",
    
    # Physics
    "BLINK_LEN": 3         # 3 for blink, 15 for smoking/drinking
}
